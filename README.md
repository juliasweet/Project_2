All members of the group contributed to each part of the project.
We decided on a topic together and all combed Kaggle for resources. Ultimately, we decided to use CSV and JSON files taken directly from FEMA's web site, which Kyle found. 
We decided as a group which tables and columns we should include in our database, and Kyle designed the database and provided the schema. We divided the ETL task as follows: 
- Julia Sweet wrote the starter code for loading and transforming the CSV and JSON files. She also provided a template text for the process description portion of the web pages. 
- Julia Smith extracted, cleaned, and loaded the Disaster Declaration file and wrote the text for that part of the website. 
- John Goodale extracted, cleaned, and loaded the Declaration Areas file and wrote the text for that part of the website. 
- Ricardo Bonner extracted, cleaned, and loaded the Disaster Summaries file and wrote the text for that part of the website. 
In order to check our database, Kyle ran a query to return only tornadoes. To confirm this, Julia Sweet replicated the results using Pandas. 
Finally, to display our data, Kyle created a web site.
